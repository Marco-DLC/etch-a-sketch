# Etch-a-Sketch Odin Project

This program will create a 16x16 div grid that can be customized up to
100x100. When the user hovers the mouse over a div square, it will
change colors and stay that way, leaving a trail following the mouse.
This can be used to create simple continuous line art similar to how an
etch-a-sketch toy would function.
